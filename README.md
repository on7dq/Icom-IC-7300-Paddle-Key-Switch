Avoid having to push 8 keystrokes on your IC-7300, to make the switch from paddle to straight key !
Easy with just one button press with this project.

NEW VERSION - FEB 2023

I brushed up the code, and added some code for the remaining buttons.
Of course you don't need a Nintendo Controller, you can build it any way you want, all you need is any Arduino board and 8 buttons, a diode, and some wire.

See description of the new version here
